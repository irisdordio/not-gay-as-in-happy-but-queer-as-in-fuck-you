                    <span class="word">Beginning</span> during the 1980‚Äôs as an offshoot of the punk subculture,
                    Queercore came to be a response to mainstream gay and punk culture from the time, as a new
                    subculture for those that did not fit a particular narrative from both subcultures. Since its
                    formation, Queercore was inherently political, fighting traditional values in punk and sexuality. It
                    shunned commercialism, capitalism, stayed on the sidelines, rejected mainstream values and was
                    rooted in gay and punk scenes.

                <div class="p1">
                    Originally named Homocore, it was born as a zine that ran for eight issues ‚Äì starting from 1985 to
                    1991. At the time, the zines featured themes such as explicit content as nudity and gays slurs since
                    they weren‚Äôt concerned with being taken seriously.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Queercore was known for embodying a general discontent with society regarding societal disapprove of
                    the LGBT community, issues and prejudices of sexual identity, gender identity, human rights,
                    political and religious oppression and many others. It materialized itself in various ways: zines
                    and magazines, music, poetry, writing, art, film and performances.

                (Genitals are the focus of the tabu. I like breasts, although I enjoy ass much more.) I'm Garcia, that
                hot mature woman that's 9km away from you. I am also other <span class="text">egos</span>, but I don't
                even bother understanding or naming <span class="text">them</span> since they are in ceaseless mutation
                only to be represented momentarily. A few ones can be given away, though ‚Äî David, Manuel and √âs um Conas
                (You're a Cunt). My <span class="text">alter egos</span> are self-absorbed explorations that materialize
                into self-analysis illustrations. Here is where I expose the egos influenced by emotions, objects,
                animals or situations experienced.
                <img src="/img/david08.png" alt="" class="omg">
                <div class="p2">
                    When I started doing my first illustrations, it felt much more to me that the message I was eager to
                    pass was criticism towards society. It was more within the strokes of satire and irony. The theme
                    mostly present in my work was religion, specifically Christianity ‚Äî this was also an unconscious
                    expansion of me. Still, at the time, I hadn't understood that yet. I might not think much of what I
                    *do*, but I indeed reflect on why I illustrate specific themes ‚Äî on why I draw. That's when it came
                    to be: the feeling of imprisonment made around our naked bodies. It made me feel
                    <span class="text"></span> desperate</span> for genital freedom as it rouses questions about my
                    sexuality, gender identity and gender expression.

                    Meter Mamas, meter Conas, meter Pixas (To put Breasts, to put Vaginas, to put Dicks). Just put it
                    all in. I think it's normal for us, human beings, to question everything about ourselves, be it mind
                    and body. That's how my feminine self, Garcia, came to be. Slowly materializing parts of the
                    feminine body in various illustrations through expressive pencil loose strokes on paper to capture
                    my feelings until it became an expansion of myself. Later on, transmuted onto
                    <span class="text">physical</span> incorporation.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 p-editorial text-margin">
                There's a nexus between my illustrations and gender identity. Since I don't like to label myself,
                exploring gender ideology and quotidian life through drawings, photography, or style allows me to
                step outside the artificial chains of gender that society has created. Besides Garcia, which is the
                feminine being that could care less about what the fuck you think about non-normative behaviours;
                There's also √âs um Conas (You're a Cunt). √âs um Conas came to be from exploring conservatism and the
                normative narrative that mainstream LGBTI+ culture has. Firstly this <span class="text">ego</span>
                arose as a joke using slangs to criticize conservative cunts. It is quite the labrega (big mouth)
                scene ‚Äî bicha labrega (big mouth faggot). I illustrate √âs um Conas as a provocative and judgemental
                form whose only purpose is to embarrass the viewer. It's also the only alter ego that has a fix role
                and structure.
                <div class="p2">
                    While it has had significant growth, this contributed a ton to impersonate and understand my
                    illustration style. Of course, some things contribute as inspiration to my work. The bulk of it, I'd
                    say, comes from musical genres like post-punk, darkwave, fado and baroque; and cultural movements
                    such as Punk. Punk does have a considerable influence on my ideologies, and Garcia expresses itself
                    within those viewpoints.
                </div>
                <div class="p2">
                    Now, back to where we started: I'm Garcia, that hot mature woman that's 9km away from you. Wanna

                    Moving on, Catholicism is a theme that has accompanied me since childhood. Being taught all the good

                    cousins were encouraged to be macho) significantly contributed to my interest in themes like this.

                    I can happily say that the writing in this entry (and many others) would very much displease my
                    family from my mother's side.
                </div>
                <div class="p2">
                    Now that I've resumed why the hell I love this topic so much let us proceed. <br>
                    Yes, nuns ‚Äî thinking about the fetishization of a figure that's intimately connected with God leads
                    me to believe in this as an act of breaking with the strict religious rules. Specifically, the Seven
                    Sacraments ‚Äî Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Communion, Confession, Marriage, Holy Orders, and the
                    Anointing of the Sick. Such can be observed through nunsploitation or in the underground fetish
                    communities where rubber-clad nuns are quite popular.
                </div>

                <div class="p2">
                    Nunsploitation is a subgenre of exploitation film that had its peak during the '70s in Europe. These
                    audiovisual pieces involve nuns living in convents (usually during the middle ages). The central
                    premise is mostly about religious and sexual suppression since they live in celibacy, the
                    Inquisition, and criticism against religion and the Catholic Church. Lesbian sexual relationships
                    are also prevalent in retro pornographic movies, just as religious guilt and many others. It *can*
                    be something that voices feminist dialogues (other than sexual objectification) within these pieces.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 p-editorial text-margin">
                The naughty nun's figure has persisted since the middle ages, becoming a prominent erotic figure and
                making her a cultural fascination. This troop's endurance is what keeps placing the nun in such a
                spot ‚Äî the representation of a struggle, the reconciliation of personal desires with what society
                expects.

                <div class="p2">
                    Although I like to think that nunsploitation could be the perfect medium to send a contemporary
                    feminist message regarding religion, and the women role, to today's audience, there's still work to
                    be done regarding the pornographic aspect. In comparison, pornography has tons of nuns
                    partaking in threesomes inside the church, near the sanctuary or having sex with other nuns (usually
                    inside the dorms, like how it happens in <span class="text">Mother Superior</span> (2013), Nica
                    Noelle). <br>
                    I want to leave the description of <span class="text">Mother Superior</span> down below:

                <div class="italic-text">
                    "In her most controversial film to date, Nica Noelle takes us behind the walls a religious convent
                    where beautiful nuns of all ages struggle with lesbian urges. Beautiful Jasmine Jem fears Satan has
                    taken control of her body when she succumbs to the pleasures of masturbation, but older nun Ariella
                    Ferrara has a solution. Young sisters Ashley Graham and Lea Lush steal away from a prayer session to
                    fantasize about "forbidden experiences" and decide to explore a few. Ariella Ferrara and young
                    Presley Hart pray together for the strength to overcome their sinful lust for each other, and Mother
                    Superior herself (Magdalene St. Michaels) preys on young, innocent Mae Olsen to satisfy her own dark
                    desires. Viewer discretion advised."

                <span class="word">I've</span> been consuming queer media since I was a teenager, but back then, I
                didn't really understand what voyeurism was. The concept of an individual enjoying and obtaining sexual
                gratification from seeing distress and pain in others; from observing individuals who are partly
                undressed, naked, or engaged in sexual acts. For this entry, I'd like to concentrate on the
                <span class="text">voyeur</span> in a more broad term:
                <span class="text">a person who seeks sexual stimulation by visual means.</span>
                <div class="p2">
                    This tends to happen in many audiovisual pieces, and it's not only present in queer works, directed
                    to the queer audience. Let's look closely and leave the bubble of
                    "<span class="text">not everything has to be gay</span>". This is present in everything we consume
                    on our screens (or not) like Tv shows, social media posts, videos on online platforms, magazines,
                    photographs, books, video calls, video games, etc. I didn't notice this until I began reading yuri
                    visual novels, where the plot would be centred around intimate relationships between female
                    characters‚Äîspecifically, lesbian relationships.
                </div>
                <div class="p2">
                    When playing (reading) this kind of game,
                    it's up to the player to assume the main character's role, like choice-making during dialogues and
                    gameplay dynamics. These choices will often have consequences for developing the route(s). Unless
                    it's a kinetic novel, where no options are given to the player, and there is only one possible
                    outcome. But regardless, I'll give one example of a yuri novel that really speaks for the voyeur:
                    Sakura Dungeon (or the entirety of the Sakura series, really...).
                    <span class="text">It's all about collecting cute and sexy monster girls and steamy CGs</span> ‚Äî
                    basically, and it's the perfect example of visual stimuli.
                    This is present in other visual novels, even those that are just <span class="text">fluff</span> and
                    have no adult content or whatsoever.
                </div>
                <div class="p2">
                    We don't consider voyeurism when there's no adult content due
                    to society's standardization of NSFW and SFW. So it's totally not voyeuristic to be checking out
                    that other person's Instagram page filled with swimsuit photos, but reading an issue of Playboy is.
                    We're all voyeurs; we all enjoyed the visual stimuli from watching that sexy scene from that HBO
                    series we saw the other day. Don't fuck with me.

            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 p-editorial text-margin">
                Speaking of streaming services, a few weeks ago, I finished watching Gambling School (Kakegurui ‚Äì
                Compulsive Gambler) on Netflix. Afterwards, I proceeded to consume the manga just for the
                <span class="text">canon</span> KiraSaya ship.
                <div class="p2">
                    Yes. Well, whether this series is queer bating or not,
                    there's a constant voyeurist male perspective. The two (out of three) main characters are
                    influential
                    female figures, and the other one is the self-insert male character. For the first two episodes, I
                    couldn't bear with him, but the more episodes I watched, the more I began to understand what the
                    voyeur
                    perspective meant in audiovisual pieces. The male main character Suzui represents the voyeur ‚Äî he
                    represents <span class="text">us</span>, the audience. Always observing all the subtext between the
                    female characters, the interactions and gambling games they play. Be it subtext or not, there are
                    explicit LGBTI+ themes on the show, but...the issue is how gambling and lesbianism seem to be
                    counterparts.
                </div>
                <div class="p2">
                    The premise of the series is: "
                    <span class="italic-text">Yumeko Jabami enrols at Hyakkaou Private Academy, where students are
                        ranked by their gambling winnings, and fame and fortune await those who rise to the top.</span>"
                    Here gambling is seen as a compulsion and something that is forbidden but still happens ‚Äî due to the
                    context where the anime takes place, it's not hard to understand where I'm trying to get at.
                    Gambling School inadvertently associates lesbian relationships with being taboo and a
                    <span class="text">compulsion</span>. So, the act of gambling gets the female characters off, and
                    the female characters get off on each other when they're gambling. The show warns us, the viewers,
                    that gambling has horrific effects, and if we observe the female characters detrimental and
                    destructive behaviour while playing...I feel like the show might be implying lesbian relationships
                    as something taboo and catastrophic.

                <span class="word">Body</span> Utopias are scattered entries from my journals that generally touch
                gender topics regarding the body, gender-normative behaviour and social gender roles. What you'll read
                here are passages that were edited to make one entry only for this project in specific. The writing here
                is also more raw in comparison to past articles. I wanted to use this last article to just trow unedited
                text. Although it's essential to write coherently for you, the reader, I also wanted to have a cruder
                entry regarding the writing.

                <div class="p2">
                    There were (still are) times which I wish to have been born without an assigned gender (or merely no
                    gender at all). Like gender, societal freedom to be whatever you want is only an artificial concept.
                    Femininity and masculinity are societal prisons if we abide by their specific rules in terms of
                    roles. This isn't freedom of speech at all ‚Äî at least regarding the concepts of traditional gender
                    roles, of course. Right now, in the present day, I'd say the best way to leave these "roles" is to
                    be androgynous. At least for me, it is. Nonetheless, it's also the best and safest way to express my
                    self publicly. Androgyny is the blend of masculine and feminine characteristics, creating an
                    ambiguous form. It can be expressed through gender identity, gender expression and others.
                </div>
                <div class="p2">
                    To me, I mostly use this in terms of gender expression. As for gender identity, I rather stay in the
                    "non-gendered" section. It's much of a hassle to partake in one of the sides, and I just can't take
                    the goddamn necessity of roles or when others start babbling about me being a biological female. Is
                    there really a need to assign roles to both biological sexes?
                </div>

            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 p-editorial text-margin">
                One of the few things I observe when seeing others confronted with reversed roles, or the smash of
                these roles, is confusion. I just don't understand why and can't help but laugh on the inside. It's as
                if they are specifically programmed with some kind of code, and when encountered with an anomaly on the
                program, the code stops functioning. Well, technically, there is a "programming" since these are
                societal concepts, so I suppose it must be a shock. Some of my family members can't bear the "hurt" when
                I shave my hair every 3 months. Yes, it's really pitiful. Really hate to hurt others with my Hair
                clipper; what a drag. You know what I also hate? Gatekeeping honey.

                    Moving on. A few months ago, I had an appointment at the [insert place] and had arrived way too
                    early. It was pretty cold, and I was wearing baggy clothing, plus a beanie. To make up time, I
                    decided to grab some coffee from a nearby coffee shop. The place was mostly empty, but I was able to
                    immediately order what I wanted. Hmm...I don't think I've ever seen someone in such a state of panic
                    because they couldn't identify thy gender. SHE; HE. F√ÅTIMA, THERE'S A PERSON HERE.

                    Don't sweat, my bro. I picked up the coffee and left. Haven't gone there since then.
                    Am I picky with all of this? Sometimes it feels more like I'm rumbling instead of writing juicy
                    stuff.
