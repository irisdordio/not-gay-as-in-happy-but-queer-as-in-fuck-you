# not-gay-as-in-happy-but-queer-as-in-fuck-you
Since 2019, I have developed a journaling habit. Usually, I write whatever I feel like – my days, worries, anxieties and mental issues, shower thoughts, struggles with gender identity, repugnance towards prejudice regarding homosexuality, representation of queer female characters in shows or movies, gender expression, sexuality, feminism and religion. The intention is to pour content written by me in the form of entries accompanied by photography, drawings and screencaps.
Illustrations are created by one of my closest friends, David Garcia in which he represents the feminine body – a materialization of how and what they feel while creating. Different art mediums allow them to exhibit different feminine personas.
